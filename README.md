# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine program:

This project included the analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of a paid Amazon Vine program or other reviewers to determine if there is any bias for favorable reiews by the reviewers in the Amazon Vine Program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. 

The goal of this project was to use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, PySpark was used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. The [Amazon Watch dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Watches_v1_00.tsv.gz) was used in the dataset. 

Programming Tools:
- 
- Amazon AWS RDS Instance
- pgAdmin 4 (Prostgres SQL 14.2)
- pySpark
- Google Colab Notebook
